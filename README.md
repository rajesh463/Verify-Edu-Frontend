Institutional Verified Individual Education Records Using Blockchain

Overview

This project leverages blockchain technology to create a secure and tamper-proof system for storing and verifying educational records. It addresses the limitations of traditional record-keeping methods by ensuring authenticity, security, and global accessibility of academic credentials.

Features
Student Profile Management: Allows students to create and manage their profiles.
Document Upload: Secure upload of educational documents for verification.
Institute Verification: Institutes verify the authenticity of documents.
Blockchain Integration: Stores verified documents on the blockchain for tamper-proof security.
Third-Party Access: Employers and other authorized entities can request access to verified records.
System Architecture
The system includes the following modules:

Student Login: For profile creation, document upload, and tracking verification status.
Institute Login: For verifying and approving student documents.
Admin Dashboard: To monitor system activities and manage user permissions.
Blockchain Storage: Ensures secure and immutable storage of verified records.
Third-Party API: Allows external entities to request and verify student credentials.
Technology Stack
Frontend: React.js
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MySQL
Blockchain: Ethereum (or any other blockchain platform)
API Integration: RESTful APIs for third-party access

Usage
Students can register, log in, and upload their educational documents for verification.
Institutes can log in to verify submitted documents.
Once verified, documents are stored on the blockchain.
Third parties can request access to verified records through the API.
Challenges Addressed
Eliminates document forgery through blockchain immutability.
Ensures global accessibility for educational credentials.
Streamlines verification processes for institutions and third parties.
Future Directions
Support for multi-blockchain integration.
Enhanced privacy controls using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs).
Scalability improvements for large-scale adoption.
